=== Responsibility

ThemeTarget is responsible for hooking up UI-Elements to the link:ThemeManager.adoc[ThemeManager] in order to create a central place to manage colors and style. 



=== How it works

After adding the ThemeTarget to a component, there is only reference to choose: The `Theme Component Name` of the ThemeTarget. This is the source for the color of this object.

_Note: `ButtonTarget` for example has 5 `Theme Component Names`. They all work like the first one, however a `Button` needs multiple colors.

=== Required Components

* `Theme Component Name`
** Represents the group, which the Target inherits their color from the active link:Theme.adoc[Theme]
