= Training for Catch

== Preamble

This scenario contains two agents in a small closed arena.
The goals are simple.
One (prey) must not be catched by the other (predator).

This scenario is merely an end-to-end for the workflow, but could later maybe used as a mini game.

== Training Log

This should track the training so anything can be reproduced later on.

=== Increase networks to observation `catch02`

This is a test for how large the file will be as I increased the layer size massively.

==== What did not work

The `hidden_units: 50410` was way to big for training on a laptop.
We could try it on a bigger machine.
